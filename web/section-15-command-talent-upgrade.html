        This hotkey is not something that you use very often.<br>
        Literally up to 8 times in a very long game.

        But there was a period of my life when I was a Turbo enjoyer, where it's not rare to get a big level up in the middle of a fight.

        That's how I found out that having a hotkey for <act>Upgrade Talent</act> is more comfortable than not having it. I felt annoyed I had to press the "plus sign" with the cursor. This sounds ridiculous as I write this but it's true.

        <act>Upgrade Talent</act> is fantastic on <kbd>`</kbd> (grave), because you then select the left-or-right talent with <kbd>1</kbd> or <kbd>2</kbd> which are right next to it. It's instant and makes perfect sense.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Upgrade Talents:</b> <kbd>`</kbd></li>
        <li><b>Upgrade Left Talent:</b> <kbd>1</kbd></li>
        <li><b>Upgrade Right Talent:</b> <kbd>2</kbd></li>
        <li><b>Upgrade Attributes:</b> <kbd>3</kbd><- or -><kbd>none</kbd></li>
      </ul>

        <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>2</kbd> can't be used for talent upgrades.<br>
        When you try to use <kbd>Alt</kbd> for <act>Upgrade Talent</act> — the game just alerts the talent status in chat.

        You may also want to unbind <act>Upgrade Attributes</act> to prevent accidentally selecting it.
