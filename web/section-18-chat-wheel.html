      <h2>Chat Wheel</h2>

      <p>
        This is not for flavor — this is a <b>mandatory bind</b>. It has to be easily accessible.<br>
        Emotional Damage is a real thing, as is Emotional Support.

        The <act>Chat Wheel</act> is something that I use all the time, so the hotkey has to be good.

      <h2>Chat Wheel 1 Setup</h2>
        
      <p>
        Over a decade I figured this is <b>the</b> required setup to play.<br>
        I <i>really</i> want these call-outs on hand.
      </p>
    
      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/options-chat-wheel-full-01.jpg" alt=""> 

      <p class="mt2">
        Towards the top I have progressively "aggressive" call-outs.<br>
        Towards the bottom I have progressively "defensive" call-outs.
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        On the left I have "suggestions what to do".<br>
        On the right I have "be aware of my perspective".
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        It's actually crazy how much it makes sense.
      </p>

      <p class="separator mt2"></p>

      <p class="mt2">
        <act>Go</act> and <act>Get Back</act> are obvious. Required for any coordination.
      </p>
     
      <p class="separator mt2"></p>

      <p class="mt2">
        <act>Fight Under Tower</act> probably contributes to half of my MMR.<br>
        Synergizes perfectly well with every other call-out.
      </p>
      
      <p class="mt2">
        <act>Fight Under Tower</act> is the ultimate "<b>DO NOT DO ANYTHING STUPID</b>".
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        Prepares the team for action.<br>
        Reminds them not to dive.<br>
        Reminds them not to chase off your own high-ground.
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        It's the best.<br>
        Treat everyone like they have a 3 second memory.
      </p>

      <p class="separator mt2"></p>

      <p class="mt2">
        <act>Spread Out</act> is important for any pre-teamfight action, especially when facing big ultimates such as <span class="nowrap"><spell>Black Hole</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/blackhole.jpg" alt=""></span>, <span class="nowrap"><spell>Reverse Polarity</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/reversepolarity.jpg" alt=""></span>, <span class="nowrap"><spell>Chronosphere</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/chronosphere.jpg" alt=""></span>, etc.
      </p> 
      
      <p class="mt2">
        Generally useful around objectives, especially high-ground.
      </p>
      
      <p class="mt2">
        When used with <act>Get Back</act> or <act>I'm retreating</act> works as the "<b>Please Disperse</b>" call-out to forfeit an objective, so that everyone is free to push out lanes or get extra farm.
      </p>
     
      <p class="separator mt2"></p>

      <p class="mt2">
        <act>Group Up</act> serves as the "<b>Get Ready</b>" and "<b>Let's Go</b>" call-outs.<br>
        It's also useful when you actually want to group up, i.e. for <span class="nowrap"><spell>Greaves</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/itemicon/greaves.jpg" alt=""></span> or <span class="nowrap"><spell>Smokes</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/itemicon/smoke.jpg" alt=""></span>
      </p>      

      <p class="separator mt2"></p>

      <p class="mt2">
        <act>On my way</act> indicates our intent <b>to join</b>.<br>
        It serves as "<b>Wait for me</b>" and "<b>I'm not there yet</b>" at the same time.
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        <act>I'm retreating</act> indicates our intent <b>not to join</b>.
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        These are great call-outs, because they lower the chance of our team overextending.<br>
        The team needs to know whether they can rely on <b>us</b> to make better decisions.
      </p>

      <p class="separator mt2"></p>

      <p class="mt2">
        <act>All miss</act> is a great call-out for "<b>They are smoked</b><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/itemicon/smoke.jpg" alt="">", "<b>They are ganking</b>", "<b>Watch the minimap</b>" and "<b>Careful</b>."
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        Use with <act>Fight under tower</act>, <act>Get back</act> and <act>Group Up</act> to bring your team into safety.
      </p>
