      <h2>On mouse buttons...</h2>
        
      <p>
        I highly recommend <b>NOT</b> binding any actions to mouse side buttons.<br>
        Use the mouse for aiming.
      </p>
      
      <p class="mt2">3 reasons <b>NOT</b> to bind any actions to mouse:<br>
      
        1. Your grip is worse, because you have to account for the buttons in your grip.<br>
        2. Your aim is worse, because your grip is worse.<br>
        3. Your hand is more strained, because of the bad grip.
      </p>

        Honestly, it's very hard to explain the true effect, and I encourage you to experiment. Listen to your body.

        I've used <kbd>Mouse side button 1</kbd> for my <span class="nowrap"><spell>Blink Dagger</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/itemicon/blinkdagger.jpg" alt=""></span> for about <b>15 years</b> (!).<br>
        I <i>felt</i> like I needed that extra button — but I just had a bad keyboard layout, so I had to compensate with putting buttons on the mouse.

        So one day (after playing years of Starcraft 2), I decided to fix my hotkeys.<br>
        And everything started to feel lighter. Quicker.<br>   
        Every part of your gameplay will benefit from having a better interface between your brain and your fingers.

      <p class="mt2">
        I highly recommend against binding actions to mouse side buttons whenever possible.
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        p.s. As a side note, I found <kbd>Enter</kbd> & <kbd>Backspace</kbd> truly the BEST buttons as mouse side buttons in general.
