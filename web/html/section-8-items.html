	<h2>Items</h2>

	<p>
	Arguably, instant access to items is even more important than instant access to abilities.<br>
	That's why we bind items to Quick Cast.
	</p>

	<p class="mt2">
	And just like with abilities — we must have instant access to self-cast.<br>
	That's why we <b>don't</b> bind items to <kbd>Alt</kbd> a.k.a. the HoN item binds.
	</p>

	<p class="mt2">
	We also want it to be intuitive and easily accessible.<br>
	That's why we bind items right below the ability row.
	</p>

	<ul>
	<li><b>Items:</b> <kbd>A</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd> <kbd>Z</kbd> <kbd>X</kbd> <kbd>C</kbd></li>
	<li><b>Items (Self):</b> <kbd>A</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd> <kbd>Z</kbd> <kbd>X</kbd> <kbd>C</kbd> + <kbmod>Alt</kbmod></li>
	</ul>

	<p class="mt2">
	This way all the 6 items are easily accessible, self-cast is easily accessible and the layout is visually coherent with the in-game interface.
	</p>

	You will never misclick, forget about or misuse anything this way.
