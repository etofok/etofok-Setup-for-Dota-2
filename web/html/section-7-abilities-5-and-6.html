      <h2>Abilities — Ability 5 & 6</h2>  

      <p class="mt2">
        Extending our 'Ability row' to the right is not ideal. <br>
        While <kbd>T</kbd> is somewhat ok — <kbd>Y</kbd> is just terrible.<br><br>
        Also we want to keep in mind that not every hero <i>even has</i> <act>Ability 5</act> & <act>Ability 6</act>.<br>
        And when they do, sometimes they are important and something not at all.<br>
      </p>      

      <p class="mt2">
        And sometimes one of the 'Core 4' abilities is a passive.
      </p>

      <div class="separator mt2"></div>

      <p class="mt2">I'm going to start with a simple example:</p>

      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/abilities-phantom-assassin-binds-01.jpg" alt="">

      <p>
        Considering the fact that <span class="nowrap"><spell>Phantom Assassin</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/heroicon/phantomassassin.jpg" alt=""></span> has no summons, doesn't really buy <span class="nowrap"><spell>Manta Style</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/itemicon/mantastyle.jpg" alt=""></span>, and never gets <span class="nowrap"><spell>Book of the Dead</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/itemicon/bookofthedead.jpg" alt=""></span> — she's probably the simplest hero in the game in terms of unit control.
      </p>

      <div class="separator mt2"></div>

      <p class="mt2">
        Another example is <span class="nowrap"><spell>Ogre Magi</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/heroicon/ogremagi.jpg" alt=""></span>.
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        6 Abilities, but <span class="nowrap"><spell>Multicast</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/multicast.jpg" alt=""></span> is a <i>passive</i>.<br>
        It can't be activated.<br>
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        So, let's use <kbd>R</kbd> for one of the other abilities:
      </p>

      <p>
        Leave <span class="nowrap"><spell>Bloodlust</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/bloodlust.jpg" alt=""></span> on <kbd>E</kbd> and move <span class="nowrap"><spell>Fire Shield</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/fireshield.jpg" alt=""></span> to <kbd>R</kbd>.
      </p>

      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/abilities-ogremagi-binds.jpg" alt="">

      <p>
        This is reasonable, because both of our 'buff abilities' are next to each other and use great keys.<br>
        But this is not ideal, because...
      </p>

      <div class="separator mt2"></div>

      <p class="mt2"><span class="red">Important!</span><br><br>
        You still <b>want</b> a hotkey for your passive abilities:<br>
        If you don't have a hotkey, you can't use <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>Ability Key</kbd> to learn the ability.<br>
        You don't need <i>a great</i> key, but you <b>do</b> need <i>a</i> key.
      </p>

      <div class="separator mt2"></div>

      <p class="mt2">
        Let's try something with 6 <i>active</i> buttons:
      </p>

      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/abilities-hoodwink-binds-01.jpg" alt=""> 

      <p>
        This is really clunky and looks awful.
      </p> 

      <p class="mt2">
        But I want to highlight something — <b>it is possible to bind abilities to control group keys</b>.
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        <span class="red">Important:</span> despite the fact that we have <act>Control Group 4</act> bound to <kbd>4</kbd>, it's still possible to use <kbd>4</kbd> as an ability key!
      </p>
      
      <p class="mt2">
        That's great news, because <span class="nowrap"><spell>Hoodwink</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/heroicon/hoodwink.jpg" alt=""></span> has no use for this many control groups, so keys like <kbd>3</kbd>, <kbd>4</kbd> and <kbd>5</kbd> are essentially free real estate.
      </p>
      
      <p class="mt2">
        Realistically, the only other units you <i>might</i> have when playing <span class="nowrap"><spell>Hoodwink</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/heroicon/hoodwink.jpg" alt=""></span> is <span class="nowrap"><spell>Book of the Dead</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/itemicon/bookofthedead.jpg" alt=""></span>, for which you don't even need a dedicated control group because you can just use <act>Select All Other Units</act> <span class="smaller">(more on that later)</span>.
      </p>
      
      <p class="mt2">
        This means, <span class="nowrap"><spell>Hoodwink</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/heroicon/hoodwink.jpg" alt=""></span> — among many — can get away with <b>0 control groups</b>.<br>
        We can easily have a set up like this:
      </p>

      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/abilities-hoodwink-binds-02.jpg" alt=""> 

      <p>
        or even like this:
      </p>

      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/abilities-hoodwink-binds-03.jpg" alt=""> 

      <p>
        That's pretty comfortable for a hero with 6 active buttons, don't you think?
      </p>

      <div class="separator mt2"></div>

      <p class="mt2">
        Here's <span class="nowrap"><spell>Invoker</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/heroicon/invoker.jpg" alt=""></span>, and he's no more difficult:
      </p>

      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/abilities-invoker-binds-01.jpg" alt="">

      <p class="mt2">
        Alternatively, if you don't care about control groups — just bind them. <br>
        Leave <kbd>2</kbd> for <span class="nowrap"><spell>Forge Spirit</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/forgespirit.jpg" alt=""></span> and use something like this:
      </p>

      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/abilities-invoker-binds-02.jpg" alt="">

      <p class="mt2">
        Ideally, to next-level your <span class="nowrap"><spell>Invoker</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/heroicon/invoker.jpg" alt=""></span> you'd want to cast <span class="nowrap"><spell>Invoke</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/invoke.jpg" alt=""></span> with your thumb — so that you use all the fingers. It's more efficient this way, and faster.<br>
        But that's a story for another day.
