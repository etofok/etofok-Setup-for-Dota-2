      <h2>Abilities — Ability 5 & 6</h2>  

      <p class="mt2">
        Extending our 'Ability row' to the right is not ideal. <br>
        While <kbd>T</kbd> is good key, <kbd>Y</kbd> is not.
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        But not every hero <i>has</i> <act>Ability 5</act> or/and <act>Ability 6</act>.<br>
        And if they do, some abilities are very important and some are rarely used.<br>
        Some abilities are passives.
      </p>      

      <p class="mt2">
        I believe I found a solution.
      </p>

      <div class="separator mt2"></div>

      <p class="mt2">I'm going to start with a simple example:</p>

      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/abilities-phantom-assassin-binds-01.jpg" alt="">

      <p class="mt2">
        Here we moved <span class="nowrap"><spell>Fan of Knives</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/fanofknives.jpg" alt=""></span> from <kbd>T</kbd> to <kbd>R</kbd>, because <span class="nowrap"><spell>Coup De Grace</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/coupdegrace.jpg" alt=""></span> is a passive ability.<br><br>
        We just made it easier for outselves to use it.
      </p>      

      <div class="separator mt2"></div>

      <p class="mt2">
        Another example: <span class="nowrap"><spell>Ogre Magi</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/heroicon/ogremagi.jpg" alt=""></span>.
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        <span class="nowrap"><spell>Multicast</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/multicast.jpg" alt=""></span> is a <i>passive</i>.<br>
        It can't be activated.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here we moved <span class="nowrap"><spell>Fire Shield</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/fireshield.jpg" alt=""></span> to <kbd>R</kbd>.
      </p>

      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/abilities-ogremagi-binds.jpg" alt="">

      <p>
        This is reasonable, because both of our 'buff abilities' <span class="nowrap"><spell>Bloodlust</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/bloodlust.jpg" alt=""> and <spell>Fire Shield</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/fireshield.jpg" alt=""></span> are next to each other and use great keys.<br>
      </p>

      <div class="separator mt2"></div>

      <p class="mt2">
        <span class="red">> > Important! < <</span><br><br>
        You still <b>need</b> a hotkey for your passive abilities!<br><br>
        If you don't have a hotkey, you can't use <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>Ability Key</kbd> to LEARN the ability.
      </p>      

      <p class="mt2">
        You don't need <i>a great</i> key, but you <b>do need</b> <i>a</i> key.
      </p>

      <div class="separator mt2"></div>

      <p class="mt2">
        Here I want to highlight something...
      </p>

      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/abilities-hoodwink-binds-01.jpg" alt=""> 

      <p class="mt2">
        <span class="red">It is possible to bind abilities to control group keys!</span>
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        Despite the fact that we have <act>Control Group 4</act> bound to <kbd>4</kbd>, we can use <kbd>4</kbd> as an ability key!
      </p>
      
      <p class="mt2">
        That's <i>fantastic news</i>, because most of the time we have no use for this many control groups, so keys like <kbd>3</kbd>, <kbd>4</kbd> and <kbd>5</kbd> are essentially free real estate.
      </p>
      
      <p class="mt2">
        This means, <span class="nowrap"><spell>Hoodwink</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/heroicon/hoodwink.jpg" alt=""></span> — and many other heroes — can get away with <b>0 control groups</b>.<br>
        We can easily have a set up like this:
      </p>

      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/abilities-hoodwink-binds-02.jpg" alt=""> 

      <p>
        or even like this:
      </p>

      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/abilities-hoodwink-binds-03.jpg" alt=""> 

      <p>
        That's pretty comfortable for a hero with 6 active buttons, don't you think?
      </p>

      <div class="separator mt2"></div>

      <p class="mt2">
        Here are two variations for <span class="nowrap"><spell>Invoker</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/heroicon/invoker.jpg" alt=""></span>
      </p>

      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/abilities-invoker-binds-01.jpg" alt="">

      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/abilities-invoker-binds-02.jpg" alt="">

      <p class="mt2">
        Leave <kbd>2</kbd> for <span class="nowrap"><spell>Forge Spirits</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/forgespirit.jpg" alt=""></span>
      </p>

      <div class="separator mt2"></div>

      <p class="mt2">
        Now you can experiement with your hotkeys to find the best set up for your heroes.
      </p>
