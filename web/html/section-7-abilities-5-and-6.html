      <h2>Abilities — Ability 5 & 6</h2>  

      <p class="mt2">
        Not every hero has <act>Ability 5</act> or/and <act>Ability 6</act>.<br><br>

        And when they do, some abilities are very important and some rarely used.<br>
        Some abilities are passive abilities, which can't even be activated...
      </p>      

      <p class="mt2">
        I believe I found a solution.
      </p>

      <div class="separator mt2"></div>

      <p class="mt2">I'm going to start with a simple example:</p>

      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/abilities-phantom-assassin-binds-01.jpg" alt="">

      <p class="mt2">
        <span class="nowrap"><spell>Сoup De Grace</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/coupdegrace.jpg" alt=""></span> is a passive ability.<br>
        You can't activate it. It's a passive.<br><br>

        <span class="nowrap"><spell>Сoup De Grace</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/coupdegrace.jpg" alt=""></span> on <kbd>R</kbd> is basically a waste of the key.<br>
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        So, let's move <span class="nowrap"><spell>Fan of Knives</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/fanofknives.jpg" alt=""></span> to <kbd>R</kbd> instead.<br>
        We just made it easier for ourselves to use <span class="nowrap"><spell>Fan of Knives</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/fanofknives.jpg" alt=""></span>
      </p>      

      <div class="separator mt2"></div>

      <p class="mt2">
        Another example, <span class="nowrap"><spell>Ogre Magi</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/heroicon/ogremagi.jpg" alt=""></span>
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        <span class="nowrap"><spell>Multicast</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/multicast.jpg" alt=""></span> is a passive ability.<br>
        You can't activate it.
      </p>

      <p>
        So let's move <span class="nowrap"><spell>Fire Shield</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/fireshield.jpg" alt=""></span> to <kbd>R</kbd> in its place, why not?
      </p>

      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/abilities-ogremagi-binds.jpg" alt="">

      <p>
        This is reasonable, because both of our 'buff abilities' <span class="nowrap"><spell>Bloodlust</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/bloodlust.jpg" alt=""></span> and <span class="nowrap"><spell>Fire Shield</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/fireshield.jpg" alt=""></span> are next to each other and use very good keys.<br>
      </p>

      <p>
        Feel free to swap <kbd>R</kbd> and <kbd>T</kbd> around.
      </p>

      <div class="separator mt2"></div>

      <p class="mt2">
        <span class="red">> > Important! < <</span><br><br>
        You still <b>need</b> a hotkey for your passive abilities!<br>
        If you don't have a hotkey, you can't <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>Ability Key</kbd> to <i>upgrade</i> the ability.
      </p>      

      <p class="mt2">
        You don't need <b><u>a great</b></u> key, but you do need <b><u>a</b></u> key.
      </p>

      <div class="separator mt2"></div>

      <p class="mt2">
        Here I want to highlight something...
      </p>

      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/abilities-hoodwink-binds-01.jpg" alt=""> 

      <p class="mt2">
        Despite the fact that we have <act>Control Group 4</act> bound to <kbd>4</kbd>, we can use <kbd>4</kbd> as an ability key!
      </p>
      
      <p class="mt2">
        <span class="red">It is possible to bind abilities to control group keys!</span>
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        That's <i>fantastic</i> news, because most heroes have no use for many control groups, so keys like <kbd>3</kbd>, <kbd>4</kbd> and <kbd>5</kbd> are essentially <i>free real estate</i>.
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        We can easily have a set up like this:
      </p>

      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/abilities-hoodwink-binds-02.jpg" alt=""> 

      <p>
        or even like this:
      </p>

      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/abilities-hoodwink-binds-03.jpg" alt=""> 

      <p>
        That's pretty comfortable for a hero with 6 active buttons, don't you think?
      </p>

      <div class="separator mt2"></div>

      <p class="mt2">
        <span class="red">Please note!</span><br><br>
        For this to work, you <b>must</b> bind the <u>ability itself</u> <i>per hero</i>.<br>
        Not as a "global" bind.<br><br>

        Like this:
      </p>      

      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/abilities-hoodwink-binds-04.jpg" alt="">

      <div class="separator mt2"></div>

      <p class="mt2">
        Now equipped with this new knowledge let's revisit our <span class="nowrap"><spell>Ogre Magi</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/heroicon/ogremagi.jpg" alt=""></span>
      </p>

      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/abilities-ogremagi-binds-04.jpg" alt="">

      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/abilities-ogremagi-binds-05.jpg" alt="">

      <p class="mt2">
        This looks nice.<br>
        But there's a <b>problem</b>.<br><br>

        Specifically <kbd>4</kbd><span class="nowrap"><spell>Fire Shield</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/fireshield.jpg" alt=""></span> is the problem.<br><br>

        We <b class="red">don't want</b> to use <kbd>1</kbd><kbd>2</kbd><kbd>3</kbd><kbd>4</kbd><kbd>5</kbd> for abilities that can be <kbd>ALT</kbd>-casted.<br>
        <span class="smaller">(spoiler: we will need these keys for efficiency)</span><br><br>

        Which means we have to bind <span class="nowrap"><spell>Fire Shield</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/fireshield.jpg" alt=""></span> to <kbd>R</kbd> or <kbd>T</kbd>.<br>
        This way we can self-cast it with <kbd>ALT</kbd><kbd>R</kbd> or <kbd>ALT</kbd><kbd>T</kbd>.<br><br>

        So realistically, these are the <span class="nowrap"><spell>Ogre Magi</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/heroicon/ogremagi.jpg" alt=""></span> binds:
      </p>

      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/abilities-ogremagi-binds-06.jpg" alt="">
      
      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/abilities-ogremagi-binds-07.jpg" alt="">

      <p class="mt2">
        Again, the reason we are doing it this way is because we will use <kbd>ALT</kbd><kbd>1</kbd><kbd>2</kbd><kbd>3</kbd><kbd>4</kbd> for other very important actions.<br><br>
        Any ability that you want to <kbd>ALT</kbd>-cast should <b><u>NOT</u></b> be on <kbd>1</kbd><kbd>2</kbd><kbd>3</kbd><kbd>4</kbd>.
      </p>

      <div class="separator mt2"></div>

      <p class="mt2">
        Here's <span class="nowrap"><spell>Invoker</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/heroicon/invoker.jpg" alt=""></span>
      </p>

      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/abilities-invoker-binds-03.jpg" alt="">

      <p class="mt2">
        Leave <kbd>2</kbd> for <span class="nowrap"><spell>Forge Spirits</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/forgespirit.jpg" alt=""></span>
      </p>      

      <p class="mt2">
        As pointed out by Streamors we can't use <kbd>3</kbd><kbd>4</kbd> for invoked spells, because <span class="nowrap"><spell>Alacrity</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/alacrity.jpg" alt=""></span> is a spell that we want to self-cast and it can be in either 'slot'.<br><br>

        That's why we will not use <kbd>3</kbd><kbd>4</kbd> for invoked spells.
      </p>

      <p class="mt4">
        As a side note, to truly min-max <span class="nowrap"><spell>Invoker</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/heroicon/invoker.jpg" alt=""></span> you'd want a very specific setup, which is beyond the scope of this write-up.<br><br>

        All we are trying to do here — is to build a general 'platform' that works for everything in all situations.<br><br>
        And, as you can see, there are a lot of things to consider.
