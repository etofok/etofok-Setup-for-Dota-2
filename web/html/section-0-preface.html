      <p>
        Now, don't worry — there'll be a plenty of images.<br>
        But let me say something before we begin...
      </p>

      <p>
        Your hotkeys should make sense:<br>
        - simple to understand<br>
        - easy to remember<br>
        - fast to press<br>
      </p>

      <p>
        The more intuitive they are, the fewer mistakes you’ll make.<br>
        And you'll execute your decisions faster.
      </p>
      
      <p class="mt2">
        Even if your decisions aren’t great, at least you won't be limited by actually doing it.
      </p>

      <div class="mt2 separator"></div>

      <p class="mt2">
        Think about it: your hotkey layout is a direct bridge between your brain and the game.<br><br>
        It's <b>the only way</b> to interact with it.
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        But when you plug a device into a computer you never want it to run slower, do you?<br>
        Why be slow when we can be quick?
      </p>

      <div class="mt2 separator"></div>

      <p class="mt2">On this page, you’ll find a VERY detailed explanation of what I consider the best Dota 2 hotkeys, settings and options possible.</p>
  
      <p class="mt2">
        I’ll explain the logic behind each decision for every hotkey and every in-game setting.
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        If your setup doesn’t really make sense...<br>
        If you feel like your hotkeys are all over the place...<br>
        If you’re looking for a lifelong upgrade to your play...<br>
        If you’re open to trying something new...<br><br>

        You will get all this just by reading this page and this is my promise.
