  <h2>Healthbars</h2>

  <p>I see no reason to use anything else but this.</p>

  <p>
    Why would I need everyone's nicknames cluttering my screen?<br>
    Especially considering the kind of nicknames Dota 2 players have.
  </p>
  
  <p class="mt2">Dota 2 nicknames is an art form, but I will appreciate it in a lobby.</p>

    <span class="green">Healthbar Notches</span>
  </p>

  <p class="mt2">
    See these vertical 'notches' on the healthbar?

    <img class="magnifiable" src="assets/images/options/options-healthbars-notch-01.jpg" alt="">

    Every notch represents 250 health points.<br><br>

    There used to be a way to change how 'big' a notch was.<br>
    But seems like it no longer works.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>dota_health_per_vertical_marker 250</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mt2">
    However, if you don't like the notches <span class="smaller">(for some reason)</span> you can remove them.

  <ul>
    <li>dota_hud_healthbars 0 — no healthbars (for making videos)</li>
    <li>dota_hud_healthbars 1 — simple healthbars for everyone</li>
    <li>dota_hud_healthbars 2 — simple healthbars for enemies only</li>
    <li>dota_hud_healthbars 3 — notched healthbars for everyone</li>

    <span class="green">Hurt indicator</span>
  </p>

  <p class="mt2">
    When a hero is hurt you can see the white flash that indicates how much damage it took.<br><br>

    <source type="video/mp4" src="assets/images/options/options-healthbars-hurt.mp4">
    </video>
  </p>

  <p class="mt2">
    And we can modify it.<br><br>
    Below are the default values:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>dota_health_hurt_decay_time_max 0.8</li>
    <li>dota_health_hurt_decay_time_min 0.3</li>
    <li>dota_health_hurt_delay 0.1</li>
    <li>dota_health_hurt_threshold 0</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mt2">
    The interesting one is the <b>threshold</b> one.<br>
    If you set the threshold value high — you won't ever see the white flash.<br><br>

    Healthbars will deplete instantly on any hit:

  <p class="mt2">
    This provides faster visual feedback (but looks worse).

  <div class="separator mt2"></div>

  <p class="mt2">
    There's currently a <i class="red">massive oversight</i> in the game.<br><br>

    If you set <act>dota_health_hurt_decay_time_min</act> to a high value...<br>
    you can easily see the main hero among its illusions.

    There is no way that's not a bug.

    A couple of years ago I disabled <act>Unit Speech</act> and now I prefer it.<br>
    It's a peaceful life.

    I disable <act>Chat Message Sound</act>.

    I used <act>Captions</act> for years — it helped me with learning English.<br>
    I like this option a lot, but it's a bit distracting and I no longer need it.
