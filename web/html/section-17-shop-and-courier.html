        <act>Shop Search Gets Focus On Open</act> makes whatever you type go into the search bar of the Shop.<br><br>
        
        Well, that makes sense...<br>
        <b>HOWEVER</b>, it consumes <i>all</i> the keys.<br><br>
        Even keys (and key combinations) like <kbd>F1</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>F1</kbd> <i>which can't even be typed</i> if you think about it.
      </p>

      <p class="mt4">
        <span class="red">This results in a scenario you don't want:</span><br><br>

        You open the shop and suddenly you need to react to something.<br><br>

        You <i>can't cast or select anything</i> until you close the shop because all the buttons you press will attempt to go into the search bar of the shop.<br>
        Closing the shop takes time, so it's very likely to get you killed as you can't react immediately.<br><br>

        I prefer my hotkeys working all the time, thank you, and for that reason I'm out.

        <span class="green">Shop Hotkeys</span><br><br>

        There's definitely a balance between simplicity and optimization.<br>
        Here's the simplest way to go about all-things-shop:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Select Courier:</b> <kbd>F1</kbd></li><br>

        <li><b>Open Shop:</b> <kbd>Alt</kbd> &nbsp + &nbsp <kbd>1</kbd></li>
        <li><b>Quickbuy:</b> <kbd>Alt</kbd>&nbsp + &nbsp <kbd>2</kbd></li>
        <li><b>Courier Deliver:</b> <kbd>Alt</kbd>&nbsp + &nbsp <kbd>3</kbd></li>
        <li><b>Courier Burst:</b> <kbd>Alt</kbd>&nbsp + &nbsp <kbd>4</kbd></li>
        <li><b>Buy Sticky:</b> <kbd>Alt</kbd>&nbsp + &nbsp <kbd>5</kbd><li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mt2">
        <kbd>F1</kbd><act>Select Courier</act> is "select" key.<br>
        So having it close to our Control Groups makes sense.
      </p>

      <div class="separator mt2"></div>

      <p class="mt2">
        You <b>want</b> the following pattern:<br>
        <act>QuickBuy</act> → <act>Courier Deliver</act> → <act>Courier Burst</act><br><br>

        And it doesn't get any simpler than <kbd>ALT</kbd><kbd>2</kbd> → <kbd>3</kbd> → <kbd>4</kbd>
      </p>

      <div class="separator mt2"></div>

      <p class="mt2">
        <span class="green">Buy Sticky</span><br><br>

        <act>Buy Sticky</act> used to be much more useful before we weren't getting free <span class="nowrap"><spell>Teleport Scrolls</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/itemicon/teleportscroll.jpg" alt=""></span> on deaths.<br>
        <span class="smaller">This was introduced in the 7.29 update (along with Dawnbreaker and Water Runes, and yes — you are getting old)</span>
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        It's still useful though.<br>
        Especially for core players, because they die less than they teleport around.
      </p>      

      <p class="mt4">
        Long story short, bind <act>Buy Sticky</act> to <kbd>ALT</kbd><kbd>5</kbd> as a "low priority extra":
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Open Shop:</b> <kbd>Alt</kbd> &nbsp + &nbsp <kbd>1</kbd></li>
        <li><b>Quickbuy:</b> <kbd>Alt</kbd>&nbsp + &nbsp <kbd>2</kbd></li>
        <li><b></span>Courier Deliver:</b> <kbd>Alt</kbd>&nbsp + &nbsp <kbd>3</kbd></li>
        <li><b></span>Courier Burst:</b> <kbd>Alt</kbd>&nbsp + &nbsp <kbd>4</kbd></li>
        <li><b class="green">Buy Sticky:</b> <kbd>Alt</kbd>&nbsp + &nbsp <kbd>5</kbd></li>
      </ul>

      <div class="separator mt2"></div>

      <p class="mt2">
        <b class="green">Consider this...</b>
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        Interestingly, I used <kbd>ALT</kbd><kbd>MouseWheelUp</kbd> for <act>Open Shop</act> for about a year.<br>
        And I honestly liked it.<br><br>

        Despite how strange it sounds, it plays very well, because you 'scroll up to see a different layer'.<br>
        I promise it's not bad.<br><br>

        But <b>the main benefit</b> is that it allows you to shift the whole thing 1 key to the left:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Open Shop:</b> <kbd>Alt</kbd> &nbsp + &nbsp <kbd>MouseWheelUp</kbd></li>
        <li><b><span class="green">← </span>Quickbuy:</b> <kbd>Alt</kbd>&nbsp + &nbsp <kbd>1</kbd></li>
        <li><b><span class="green">← </span>Courier Deliver:</b> <kbd>Alt</kbd>&nbsp + &nbsp <kbd>2</kbd></li>
        <li><b><span class="green">← </span>Courier Burst:</b> <kbd>Alt</kbd>&nbsp + &nbsp <kbd>3</kbd></li>
        <li><b><span class="green">← Buy Sticky:</span></b> <kbd>Alt</kbd>&nbsp + &nbsp <kbd>4</kbd></li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mt2">
        This is a killer layout because it solves every problem we faced in this section before I deleted a massive wall of text.<br><br>

        A possible downside is that you lose continuity with other games that might not allow you to bind <kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>MouseWheelUp</kbd> as your shop / inventory.<br><br>

        But it's probably the best for speed, because it allows you to have instant access to everything.
