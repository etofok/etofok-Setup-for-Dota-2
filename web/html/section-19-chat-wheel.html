      <h2>Chat Wheel</h2>

      <p>
        This is not for flavor — this is a <b>mandatory bind</b>. It has to be easily accessible.<br>
        Emotional Damage is a real thing, as is Emotional Support.

        The <act>Chat Wheel</act> is something that I use all the time, so the hotkey has to be good.

      <h2>Chat Wheel 1 Setup</h2>
        
      <p>
        Over a decade I figured this is <b>the</b> required setup to play.<br>
        I <i>really</i> want these call-outs on hand.
      </p>
    
      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/options-chat-wheel-full-01.jpg" alt=""> 

      <p class="mt2">
        Towards the top I have progressively "aggressive" call-outs.<br>
        Towards the bottom I have progressively "defensive" call-outs.
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        On the left I have "suggestions what to do".<br>
        On the right I have "be aware of my perspective".
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        It just makes sense.
      </p>

      <p class="separator mt2"></p>

      <p class="mt2">
        <act>Go</act> and <act>Get Back</act> are obvious.<br>
        Required for any coordination.<br>
      </p>
     
      <p class="separator mt2"></p>

      <p class="mt2">
        <act>Affirmative</act> — I like this one a lot because it adds to team spirit.<br>
        It allows you to <i>visibly</i> agree with a call, giving you a free “chemistry” boost with your teammate.<br><br>
        Now, consider this: <br>
        people are herd animals.<br><br>
        When they see two players agreeing on a call, they become much more likely to follow along.<br>
        So this phrase "double dips" into the "we are a team" vibe, which - in my opinion - is important.
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        This works even better if you’re playing with a friend, because you can <act>Affirmative</act> each other’s calls and rally the rest of the team that way.
      </p>

      <p class="separator mt2"></p>

      <p class="mt2">
        <act>Negative</act> — currently experimenting with this one.<br>
        It’s there so you can let your team know you’re not participating.<br><br>
        But does it make you win more? I'm not sure yet.
      </p>

      <p class="separator mt2"></p>

      <p class="mt2">
        <act>Fight Under Tower</act> probably contributes to half of my MMR.<br>
      </p>
      
      <p class="mt2">
        <act>Fight Under Tower</act> is the ultimate "<b>DO NOT DO ANYTHING STUPID</b>".
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        - Prepares the team for action.<br>
        - Reminds them not to dive.<br>
        - Reminds them not to chase off your own high-ground.
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        It's the best.
      </p>

      <p class="separator mt2"></p>

      <p class="mt2">
        <act>Spread Out</act> is important for any pre-teamfight action, especially when facing big ultimates such as <span class="nowrap"><spell>Black Hole</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/blackhole.jpg" alt=""></span>, <span class="nowrap"><spell>Reverse Polarity</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/reversepolarity.jpg" alt=""></span>, <span class="nowrap"><spell>Chronosphere</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/chronosphere.jpg" alt=""></span>, etc.
      </p> 
      
      <p class="mt2">
        Generally useful around objectives, especially high-ground.
      </p>

      <p class="separator mt2"></p>

      <p class="mt2">
        <act>Group Up</act> serves as the "<b>Get Ready</b>" and "<b>Let's Go</b>" call-outs.<br>
        It's also useful when you actually want to group up, i.e. for <span class="nowrap"><spell>Smokes</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/itemicon/smoke.jpg" alt=""></span>
      </p>      

      <p class="separator mt2"></p>

      <p class="mt2">
        <act>All miss</act> is a fantastic call-out for "<b>They are smoked</b><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/itemicon/smoke.jpg" alt="">", "<b>They are ganking</b>", "<b>Watch the minimap</b>" and "<b>Careful</b>."<br><br>
        I use it all the time when I don't see anyone of the minimap.<br>
        I use it even as a morale booster after a team wipe.<br><br>
        It's great!
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        Use <act>All miss</act> with <act>Fight under tower</act>, <act>Get back</act> and <act>Group Up</act> to bring your team into safety.
      </p>

      <p class="separator mt2"></p>

      <p class="mt2">
        <b>In order of importance (for me):</b><br><br>
        1. <act>Go</act> and <act>Get Back</act><br>
        2. <act>All miss</act><br>
        3. <act>Fight Under Tower</act><br>
        4. <act>Affirmative</act><br>

        The Emotions Sink wheel.<br>

      <p class="mt2">
        I really find these two VERY valuable:<br>
        <act>Nice</act><br>
        <act>Space Created</act>
      </p>
    
      <p class="mt2">
        I use <act>Nice</act> whenever something good happens.<br>
        By "good" I mean "in our favor".<br>
        This acts as a positive reinforcenment => "good job", "well done", "we're cooking", etc.<br>
        It affects the morale of the team in a positive way.
      </p>
    
      <p class="mt2">
        I use <act>Space Created</act> when something bad happens.<br>
        By "bad" I mean "not in our favor".<br>
        This phrase is somewhat funny, so it diffuses some of the negativity that builds up.<br>
      </p>
    
      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/options-chat-wheel-full-02.jpg" alt=""> 

      <p>
        My only recommendation here is to avoid using things like "Well played" to be toxic.<br>
        Tilt your opponents, not your teammates.
