      <p>
        This is not for flavor — this is a <b>mandatory bind</b>. It has to be easily accessible.<br>
        Emotional Damage is a real thing, as is Emotional Support.

        The <act>Chat Wheel</act> is something that I use all the time, so the hotkey has to be good.

      <h2>Chat Wheel 1 Setup</h2>
        
      <p>
        Over a decade I figured this is <b>the</b> required setup to play.<br>
      </p>
    
      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/options-chat-wheel-full-01.jpg" alt=""> 

      <p class="mt2">
        It just makes sense.
      </p>

      <p class="separator mt2"></p>

      <p class="mt2">
        <act>Go</act> and <act>Get Back</act> are required for any coordination.<br>
        We put them as polar opposites on the wheel (top - bottom).<br>
      </p>
     
     <p class="separator mt2"></p>

     <p class="mt2">
       <act>Group Up</act> serves as the "<b>Get Ready</b>" and "<b>Let's Go</b>" call-outs.<br>
       It's also useful when you actually want to group up, i.e. for <span class="nowrap"><spell>Smokes</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/itemicon/smoke.jpg" alt=""></span>
     </p>      

     <p class="separator mt2"></p>

     <p class="mt2">
       <act>Spread Out</act> is important for any pre-teamfight action, especially when facing big ultimates such as <span class="nowrap"><spell>Black Hole</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/blackhole.jpg" alt=""></span>, <span class="nowrap"><spell>Reverse Polarity</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/reversepolarity.jpg" alt=""></span>, <span class="nowrap"><spell>Chronosphere</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/chronosphere.jpg" alt=""></span>, etc.
     </p> 
     
     <p class="mt2">
       Generally useful around objectives, especially high-ground.
     </p>

      <p class="separator mt2"></p>

      <p class="mt2">
        <act>Fight Under Tower</act> probably contributes to half of my MMR.<br>
      </p>
      
      <p class="mt2">
        <act>Fight Under Tower</act> is the ultimate "<b>DO NOT DO ANYTHING STUPID</b>".
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        - Prepares the team for action.<br>
        - Reminds them not to dive.<br>
        - Reminds them not to chase off your own high-ground.
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        It's the best.
      </p>

      <p class="separator mt2"></p>

      <p class="mt2">
        <act>All miss</act> is a fantastic call-out for "<b>They are smoked</b><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/itemicon/smoke.jpg" alt="">", "<b>They are ganking</b>", "<b>Watch the minimap</b>" and "<b>Careful</b>."<br><br>
        I use it all the time when I don't see anyone of the minimap.<br>
        I use it even as a morale booster after a team wipe.<br><br>
        It's great!
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        Use <act>All miss</act> with <act>Fight under tower</act>, <act>Get back</act> and <act>Group Up</act> to bring your team into safety (results may vary).

      <p class="separator mt2"></p>

      <p class="mt2">
        I really find these two very valuable:<br>
        <act>Nice</act><br>
        <act>Space Created</act>
      </p>

      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/chat-wheel-nice.jpg" alt="">

      <p class="mt2">
        I use <act>Nice</act> whenever something good (or lucky) happens.<br>
        By "good" I mean "in our favor".<br><br>

        This acts as a positive reinforcenment => "good job", "well done", "we're cooking", etc.<br>
        It affects the morale of the team in a positive way.
      </p>

      <p class="mt4">
        I use <act>Space Created</act> when something bad (or unlucky) happens.<br>
        By "bad" I mean "not in our favor".<br><br>

        This phrase is somewhat funny, so it diffuses some of the negativity that builds up.<br>
      </p>


      <p class="separator mt2"></p>

      <p class="mt2">
        <b>In order of importance (for me):</b><br><br>

        1. <act>Go</act> and <act>Get Back</act><br>

        3. <act>All miss</act><br>
        4. <act>Fight Under Tower</act><br>
        5. <act>Group Up</act><br>
        6. <act>Spread Out</act><br>
        7. <act>Space Created</act>

      <p class="separator mt2"></p>

      <p class="mt2">
        You can alt-click the in-game timer to call-out the current time into chat.<br>
        This means you don't have to put this phrase on your chat wheel.

      <p class="separator mt2"></p>

      <p class="mt2">
        <b class="green">Fun Fact!</b><br><br>
        Unlike hero, ability or item names — all the chat wheel phrases are localized (translated) to other languages.<br>
        Sometimes not exactly accurately.<br><br>
        
        For example, in Russian <act>Space created</act> reads as "Enemies have been distracted", which is sort of yeah, but not really.

      <h2>Chat Wheel 2 Setup</h2>
        
      <p class="mt2">
        Use whatever, but here's a couple of extra thoughts.
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        <act>Affirmative</act> — I like this one a lot because it adds to team spirit.<br>
        It allows you to <i>visibly</i> agree with a call, giving you a free "chemistry" boost with your teammate.<br><br>
        
        Now, people are herd animals.<br>
        When they see two players agreeing on something, they are much more likely to follow along as well.<br>
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        This works even better if you're playing with a friend, because you can <act>Affirmative</act> each other's calls and rally the team that way.
      </p>

      <p class="separator mt2"></p>

      <p>
        Avoid using phases like "Well played" sarcastically.<br>
        Tilt your opponents, not your teammates.
      </p>
