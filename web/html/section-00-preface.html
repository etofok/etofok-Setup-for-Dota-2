      <p>
        Now, don't worry — there'll be a plenty of images, but let me say something before we begin:
      </p>

      <p>
        Your hotkeys should make sense.<br>
        They should be efforless.<br>
        Easy to remember.<br>
        Simple to use.
      </p>

      <p>The more intuitive they are, the fewer mistakes you’ll make, and the faster you’ll be able to execute your decisions.</p>
      
      <p class="mt2">
        Even if your decisions aren’t great, at least your execution won’t be the limiting factor.
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        Think about it: your hotkey layout is <b>the only way</b> you interact with the game.<br><br>
        It's a direct bridge between your brain and your game.
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        But when you plug a device into a computer, you never want it to run slower, do you?

      <p class="mt2">On this page, you’ll find a VERY detailed explanation of what I consider the best Dota 2 hotkeys, settings and options possible.</p>
  
      <p class="mt2">
        I’ll explain the logic behind each decision for every hotkey and every in-game setting.
      </p>
