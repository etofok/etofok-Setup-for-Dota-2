      <h2>How to Last-Hit</h2>

      <p class="mt2">
        <b>Step 1a</b><br>
        Enable <act>Auto-repeat Right Mouse</act>.
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        <b>Step 1b</b><br>
        Enable <act>Quick Attack</act>.
      </p>

      <img class="" src="assets/images/options/quickattackmove.jpg" alt="">

      <p class="mt2">
        <b>Step 2</b><br>
        Hover you mouse cursor over the target you want to last-hit.
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        <b>Step 3</b><br>
        Click <b>and hold</b> <act>Right-Click</act> on the target.<br>
        <act>Attack</act> won't work for this!<br>
        You have to use <act>Right-Click</act>!
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        <b>Step 4</b><br>
        Spam-tap the <act>Stop</act> command to cancel the attack animation.
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        This way you can reliably last-hit most creeps.
      </p>

        Choose <act>Right-Click Allies: To Deny</act> for better gameplay.

        <img class="" src="assets/images/options/options-rightclick-allies.jpg" alt="">

        <act>Right-Click Allies: To Attack</act> attempts to deny the creep <b>even</b> if it's above 50% health.<br>
        The attack animation is repeatedly cancelled until the unit falls below 50% health.<br><br>
        This effectively 'locks' your hero on target at your attack range.<br><br>

      <p class="mt2">
        There are disadvantages:<br><br>
        1) You lose the "click-to-follow".<br>
        2) You have to use the <act>Move</act> button, which is less convenient.<br>
        3) Imagine a big fight and you need to run away. If you accidentally click on <i>anything allied</i> instead of ground - your hero will <b>stop moving and turn</b> in attempt to attack it. 
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        This will surely get you killed, unless you click all things perfectly all the time. <br>
        That's why I do not recommend this.
      </p>

      <div class="separator mt2"></div>

      <p class="mt2">
        If you choose <act>Right-Click Allies: To Deny</act> and the target can't be denied - your hero will <i>walk</i> toward it and follow it.<br><br>
        This changes how you "think" about denies, because now your hero isn't 'locked'.<br><br>
        And you can't 'pre-attack' to deny, which is a minor disadvantage.
      </p>

      <div class="separator mt2"></div>

      <p class="mt2">
        However, there are <b>major</b> advantages:<br><br>
        1) You do not lose the "click-to-follow" ability.<br>
        2) You don't need the <act>Move</act> button.<br>
        3) If you accidentally click on an ally instead of ground - your hero will still move in the general direction you wanted.
