  <h2>Minimap</h2>

  <p>
    <act>Hero with Arrow</act> is objectively the best option at all times.<br>
    <kbd>Alt</kbd> should not affect it.

    I prefer <act>115%</act> and <act>Extra Large Minimap</act> because it's easier on my eyes.<br>

  <p class="mt2">
    <act>Map Background: Simple</act> has less visual noise and is neutral-gray.<br><br>
    Hero icons stand out more - especially the allies, because the direction-arrow is green.<br>
    Green on gray is better, than green on green.
  </p>
  
  <p class="mt2">
    <act>Dynamically Scale Hero Icons in Minimap</act> makes them lose their consistency.<br>
    I find it distracting, so I don't use it.

    <i>Armory → Interface → HUDS</i><br><br>

    Most HUDs were added to the game before the map got bigger.<br>
    That's why most HUDs today obscure critical portions of the map.<br><br>

    Comparison:<br>
    <span class="smaller">Default, Azure Constellation, Geniune Triumph, Cruel Diretide</span>

  <p class="mt2">
    The default HUD seems to be the best, but there are a few fancy ones that don't get in the way.<br>
    For example, this is <i>Aghanim's Labryinth 2021</i>

    <span class="green">Fun Fact!</span><br><br>
    You can make the minimap <i>even bigger</i>.<br>
    It's possible to enable  "<b>Extra <u>Extra</u> Large Minimap</b>" with this console command:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>dota_hud_extra_large_minimap 2</li>

  <h2>Minimap Misclick Protection Time</h2>
    
  <p>
    This one is interesting, because it depends on your skill level.
  </p>

  <img class="" src="assets/images/options/MisclickProtectionTime.jpg" alt=""> 

  <p class="mt2">
    Newbie players often misclick on the minimap in panic.
  </p>

  <p class="mt2">
    This notably happens to Radiant players intending to walk back to base, but they overshoot the mouse movement and accidentally click on the minimap.<br>
    This often makes them walk in whatever direction and feed.
  </p>
 
  <p class="mt2">
    That's exactly what this option is for:<br>
    it ignores all minimap input for a split second to stop this from happening.
  </p>

  <p class="mt2">
    Unfortunately, for slightly more experienced players this setting makes it worse, because the game literally doesn't register our clicks.
  </p>

  <p class="mt2">That's bad.<br><br>
  Set it to 0.</p>
