      <h2>Upgrade Talents</h2>
        
      <p>
        This is not something that you use often.<br>
        Literally up to 8 times in a very long game.
      </p>
      
      <p class="mt2">
        But there was a period of my life when I was a Turbo enjoyer, where it's not rare to get a big level up in the middle of a fight.
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        That's how I found out that having a hotkey for <act>Upgrade Talent</act> is more comfortable than not having it. I felt annoyed I had to press the "plus sign" with the cursor. This sounds ridiculous as I write this but it's true.

        <act>Upgrade Talent</act> is great on <kbd>`</kbd> (grave), because you then select the left-or-right talent with <kbd>1</kbd> or <kbd>2</kbd> which are right next to it. It's instant and makes perfect sense.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Upgrade Talents:</b> <kbd>`</kbd></li>
        <li><b>Upgrade Left Talent:</b> <kbd>1</kbd></li>
        <li><b>Upgrade Right Talent:</b> <kbd>2</kbd></li>
        <li><b>Upgrade Attributes:</b> <kbd>3</kbd> &nbsp <- or -> &nbsp <kbd>none</kbd></li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mt2">
        <span class="red">Please note!</span><br><br>

        Sometimes you want to skip the level 10 Talent and get the level 15 Talent first.<br>
        The hotkey will <b>always</b> get the talent in order of their appearance in the 'tree'.<br><br>

        So if you have not yet selected your level 10 talent — you have to be careful, because the hotkey will get you the level 10 talent.

        You may also want to unbind <act>Upgrade Attributes</act> to prevent accidentally selecting it.
