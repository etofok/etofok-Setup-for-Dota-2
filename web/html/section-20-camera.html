      <h2>Camera Grip & Edge Pan</h2>
        
      <p>
        Camera Grip is generally much better.<br>
        Especially so, if your mouse sensitivity is low (<1000).

      <p class="mt2">
        I <span class="smaller">personally</span> have <act>Edge Pan</act> disabled for years.

      <p class="mt2">
        Now, I'm not <i>against</i> <act>Edge Pan</act>.<br>
        I just don't use it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The main reason to keep <act>Edge Pan</act> disabled is for easier portrait clicks.
