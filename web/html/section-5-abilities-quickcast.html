      <h2>Abilities — Quick Cast</h2>

      <p>
        Quick Casts allow us to cast instantly with a key press, eliminating the need for a mouse click.<br>
        Put everything on Quick Casts, with one exception — <act>Point Target</act> Area of Effect spells.

        Notable examples: <span class="nowrap"><spell>Black Hole</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/blackhole.jpg" alt=""></span>, <span class="nowrap"><spell>Nether Blast</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/netherblast.jpg" alt=""></span>, <span class="nowrap"><spell>Chronosphere</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/chronosphere.jpg" alt=""></span>, etc.
      </p>

        Because we need to aim these very carefully — it's better to keep them on Normal Cast.

        Don't forget to rebind abilities onto Quick Casts for Neutrals.<br>
        Most neutrals have an ability to cast.
