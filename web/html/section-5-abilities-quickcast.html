      <h2>Abilities — Quick Cast</h2>

      <p>
        Abilities on Quick Casts fire as soon as you press the key.<br>
        You don't need to "Select Target".
      </p>
      
      <p class="mt2">
        As a rule of thumb, use Quick Casts for everything <u>except</u> Point Target Area of Effect spells like these:
        <span class="nowrap"><spell>Black Hole</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/blackhole.jpg" alt=""></span>, <span class="nowrap"><spell>Nether Blast</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/netherblast.jpg" alt=""></span>, <span class="nowrap"><spell>Chronosphere</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/chronosphere.jpg" alt=""></span>, etc.
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        We need to aim these very carefully, so it's better to keep them on Normal Cast.
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        Don't forget to set Quick Casts for Neutrals.<br>
        Most neutrals have an ability to cast.
