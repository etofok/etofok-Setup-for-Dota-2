      <h2>Abilities — Quick Cast</h2>

      <p>
        Abilities that use <b>Quick Casts</b> fire as soon as you press the key.<br>
        <b>Quick Casts</b> skip the "Select Target" part of the casting.<br>
        That's why it's quicker.
      </p>
      
      <p class="mt2">
        As a rule of thumb, use Quick Casts for everything <b>except</b> Point Target Area of Effect spells like these:
        <span class="nowrap"><spell>Black Hole</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/blackhole.jpg" alt=""></span>, <span class="nowrap"><spell>Nether Blast</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/netherblast.jpg" alt=""></span>, <span class="nowrap"><spell>Chronosphere</spell><img class="heroicon" src="assets/images/spellicon/chronosphere.jpg" alt=""></span>, etc.
      </p>

      <p class="mt2">
        We need to carefully aim these abilities, so it's better to keep them on Normal Cast.

      <p class="mt2">
        Don't forget to enable Quick Casts for Neutrals.<br>
        Most neutrals have an ability to cast.
